# Mismatched Quotes Generator
This small project was built as part of the [Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/full-stack-engineer). It uses JavaScript to generate mis-matched famous quotes and output them to the terminal.
The quote parts are defined as arrays and a number is randomly generated to select each part. The result is then returned as a template literal and printed to the console.

Here are some examples of output:
